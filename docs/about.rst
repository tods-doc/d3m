About Data Driven Discovery program
-----------------------------------

DARPA Data Driven Discovery (D3M) Program is researching ways to get
machines to build machine learning pipelines automatically. It is split
into three layers: TA1 (primitives), TA2 (systems which combine
primitives automatically into pipelines and executes them), and TA3
(end-users interfaces).
